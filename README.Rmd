# hdme

The goal of hdme is to provide penalized regression methods for High-Dimensional Measurement Error problems (errors-in-variables).

## Installation

Install `hdme` from CRAN using.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hdme")
```

You can install the latest development version from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("osorensen/hdme")
```

### Note when installing on macOS
`hdme` depends on `Rglpk`. In order to install `Rglpk` on macOS, you may need to first install `GLPK` by issuing on the command line.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
brew install glpk
```


Then install `Rglpk` using
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rglpk")
```

## Methods
hdme provides implementations of the following algorithms:

The methods implemented in the package include

* Corrected Lasso for Linear Models (@loh2012)
* Corrected Lasso for Generalized Linear Models (@sorensen2015)
* Matrix Uncertainty Selector for Linear Models (@rosenbaum2010)
* Matrix Uncertainty Selector for Generalized Linear Models (@sorensen2018)
* Matrix Uncertainty Lasso for Generalized Linear Models (@sorensen2018)
* Generalized Dantzig Selector (@james2009)
