Description: Penalized regression for generalized linear models for
  measurement error problems (aka. errors-in-variables). The package
  contains a version of the lasso (L1-penalization) which corrects
  for measurement error. It also contains an implementation of the 
  Genearalized Matrix Uncertainty Selector, which is a version the
  (Generalized) Dantzig Selector for the case of measurement error.
