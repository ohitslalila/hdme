hdme
====

The goal of hdme is to provide penalized regression methods for High-Dimensional Measurement Error problems (errors-in-variables).

Installation
------------

Install `hdme` from CRAN using.

``` r
install.packages("hdme")
```

You can install the latest development version from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("osorensen/hdme")
```

Methods
-------

hdme provides implementations of the following algorithms:

The methods implemented in the package include

-   Corrected Lasso for Linear Models (Loh and Wainwright (2012))
-   Corrected Lasso for Generalized Linear Models (Sorensen, Frigessi, and Thoresen (2015))
-   Matrix Uncertainty Selector for Linear Models (Rosenbaum and Tsybakov (2010))
-   Matrix Uncertainty Selector for Generalized Linear Models (Sorensen et al. (2018))
-   Matrix Uncertainty Lasso for Generalized Linear Models (Sorensen et al. (2018))
-   Generalized Dantzig Selector (James and Radchenko (2009))
